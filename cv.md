ABOUT 

I’m a Junior Front-End Developer with a strong background in Finance and Tourism. I work hard, learn fast and always strive for excellence. Being the Resouse Manager in EPAM Finance dept., I’m highly experienced in leading the team, conducting interviews, overlooking and improving workflows. I'm also attentive to details and always try to go an extra mile.
